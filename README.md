SnowUpdates
===========

This code is used to send PushBullet updates about skiing conditions to users cell phones.

At this point the code works with
  * Killington Ski Resort Conditions Page

**Broken right now but to be fixed**
	* Killington Peak Weather NOAA

Additional functionality needed to be added
	* Update only if more than 4" in past day
	* Update if certain trails are open
	* More ski resorts



Using PushBullet now with the help of Azelphur's [pyPushBullet](https://github.com/Azelphur/pyPushBullet 'pyPushBullet') code
