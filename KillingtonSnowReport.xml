      <title>Killington Snow Report for Tuesday, March 12, 2013</title>
      <description>&lt;strong&gt;Killington Conditions:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Open Trails: 119&lt;br /&gt;Open Lifts: 14&lt;br /&gt;Groomed Trails: 42&lt;br /&gt;Service Conditions: Machine Groomed / Spring Conditions&lt;br /&gt;Average Base Depth: 36&amp;quot; - 42&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;24 Hour Snowfall: 0&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;48 Hour Snowfall: 0&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;7 Day Snowfall: 4&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;News and Events:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;8:33 a.m. 3/12/13&lt;/i&gt; - Spring conditions continue into the week as warm temperatures stick around for Tuesday! As sometimes happens with spring, things could get a little damp out there, so grab your Gore-Tex and get the best of soft bumps and smooth corduroy as our groomers take on 66 of the open trails overnight. Think soft, soft bumps on Lower Ovation, and fresh carving on East Fall, Wildfire, and Cascade, just to name a few. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Skiers and riders can look for top to bottom spring turns across our six peaks. And while we're putting the Stash woods to bed for a moment, look for over 94 terrain park features including one of our biggest jumps ever, a Boardercross course and the Superpipe! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bump bashers, cruisers, or even brand new skiers and riders, there're 71 miles of terrain out there and one is guaranteed to be your new favorite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Key lifts spin at 9:00 a.m. Lift tickets will be $80 for adults (19-64), $68 for seniors (65+) and $62 for youths (7-18).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Killington promotes inbounds skiing or snowboarding only on open, designated trails, slopes, freestyle and tree skiing areas. Never ski or snowboard alone.</description>

Look for over 100 terrain park features, bumps, and some long cruising trails like Great Eastern.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our park crew continues to be hard at work so you can hit features in four parks, a Superpipe with four features at the end and a Boardercross Course. Plus, The Stash woods are open and waiting for you. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Key lifts spin at 9:00 a.m. Lift tickets will be $80 for adults (19-64), $68 for seniors (65+) and $62 for youths (7-18).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Killington promotes inbounds skiing or snowboarding only on open, designated trails, slopes, freestyle and tree skiing areas.
